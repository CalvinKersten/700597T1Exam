				<h1>Össur’s 'Cheetah Exceed</h1>
				<p>
					Össur’s Cheetah Xceed is a prosthetic running blade created to give a possibility to 
					people who have lost or have never had the opportunity in running sports. The 100% layered 
					carbon fibre compresses when touching the ground, storing 90-95% of the potential energy. 
					Close to the way a leg’s calf muscles and Achilles’ tendons spring and recoil. The Cheetah Xceed 
					is available in various stiffness configurations to reflect factors such as weight and foot 
					alignment in relation to the athlete’s sport of choice.

				<h1>Life Without Limitations</h1>
				<p>
					The ‘Cheetah Exceed’ will help to enable the disabled to be able. Everyday exercising plays a huge role 
					regarding human health. It should therefore be possible for everyone to be able to exercise. 
					With the help of Össur’s prosthetic leg, people with leg immobility’s will be able to run again. It is needless 
					to say that Össur is doing everything they can to live up to being true advocates of “Live Without Limitations”.

				<h1>How to use the Cheetah Xceed</h1>
				<p>
					This device is a modular component for a lower limb prosthesis. Suitability of the device for the prosthesis must 
					be evaluated by a healthcare professional. The Nike Spike Pad and Nike Spike Pad 2.0 are spike soles to be used with sport
					feet during track and field activities. The Nike Sole and Nike Sole Junior are traction devices made for running and 
					sports activities. The device is for single patient use. The device is for high to extreme impact use, e.g. fast walking, 
					running and sports.

				<h1>Usage of the Cheetah Xceed</h1>
				<p>
					The Össur’s prosthetic legs are used by people with lower leg disabilities. The Cheetah Xceed is a fairly new product, 
					sponsored by Nike. Because of the low availability of this product, not many people have been able to try it out for themselves. 
					Looking at the specifications, the Cheetah Xceed is expected to skyrocket in the market for prosthetic legs, once they come back 
					onto the market.
