					<h1>Evolution of the 'Cheetah' Running Blade</h1>
					<p>The ‘Cheetah Xceed’ blade, named after the Acinonyx jubatus (Cheetah), was originally manufactured by Icelandic manufacturers Össur. 
						The original research was done by observing cheetahs, the curved legs of the cheetah are represented in the blade design. 
						The blade works by using the user their weight, to store energy before releasing it, propelling the user forwards. 
						The ‘Cheetah’ Running Blade is created using 100% carbon fibre, structured in a specific way with each added layer of carbon fibre strengthening the blade.	
						Unfortunatly, the blades are still under development and therefore not up for sale.</p>

					<h1>Longboarding in it's original form</h1>
						<p>A plank with roller skates, nowadays the longboard is a very well-known way of transportation. The sport that started as alternative for surfing in Hawaii. 
							Once the sport got more known in other countries, people did not always find the satisfaction. They wanted more. More speed. More obstacles. More danger. 
							They started finding steeper hills with curved roads. The original longboard however was not fit for this job. New designs kept coming, each of which had their own capabilities. 
							And now, Sector nine’s ‘Meridian Swirl’ brings the users back to what longboarding originally was. Surfing on land.</p>
